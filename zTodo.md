commit
during debug, you said
I notice that the API calls are going directly to https://wwxcimelgqyilgzojyks.supabase.co/rest/v1/testimonials instead of our Next.js app's /api/testimonials route.

Are you able to review my entire code base to make sure the browser never goes direct to supabase?


Mobile preview is not matching user view
should be universal so they always match

funnel type (not tesimonial), when testimonials enabled, should not show share your experiences by default


Funel > Edit > mobile preview not showing wallet card, must match real preview
