FunL.app

Turn every sign into a live funnel that connects buyers and sellers instantly.

⸻

🚩 The Problem
	•	Buyers see a sign or flyer → they look up the property/tradie online → they get distracted or lost in the noise.
	•	Sellers miss the chance to capture buyer attention in the moment.
	•	Agents and tradies don’t have an easy way to connect physical marketing with instant digital contact.

⸻

💡 The Solution

FunL.app gives sellers a simple, dynamic funnel:
	1.	Print a weatherproof QR code on a sign or flyer.
	2.	Buyer scans → instant mobile page with seller’s contact info + call-to-action.
	3.	Seller can change the funnel anytime (For Sale → Sold → New Listing).

⸻

🎯 Example Use Cases

Real Estate
	•	QR code on “For Sale” sign.
	•	Buyer scans → page with agent contact button + property info.
	•	Later → funnel updates to “Sold for $X” + “Meet the agent.”

Tradies
