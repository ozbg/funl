“Turn every sign into a live, trackable funnel that gets buyers into your phone, not lost
Differentiation: Why wouldn’t an agent just put a QR code to their own website or realestate.com listing? Your pitch should hammer:
	•	Easier → they don’t need to know design/web/QR generation.
	•	Smarter → dynamic funnels (update messaging post-sale, swap CTA mid-campaign).
	•	Stickier → analytics + central platform + vCard save (not just a link).

Funnel for sellers
Removing friction connecting buyers with sellers
click QRcode - seller contact info in buyers phones
Sellers can add pump ups videos, testimonials etc to help buyers take step - call to action


Targeting Real Estate initially

Agents sign up , add contact info once
Then generate a Funnel (they can have multiple funnels)
Each funnel starts with a printed - UV safe - weather proof QR code 
A4 size - printed with call to a action (take photo)
That unique quote directs to FunL.au site
Each funnel is very simple - but dynamic for various cases
And the funnel can be changed throughout the campaign (For Sale messaging, changes to sold etc)
